# Snake Water Gun game
#### Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, I have implemented this game using c programming.
#### This project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.
#### Following are the rules of the game:
1. Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
2. Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
3. Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.
4. In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
